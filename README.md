## Getting Started

There are three ways to install Gentle.

1. Download the [pre-built Mac application](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle/releases/download/0.7.0/gentle-0.7.0.dmg). This package includes a GUI that will start the server and a browser. It only works on Mac OS.

2. Use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image. Just run ```docker run lowerquality/gentle```. This works anywhere Docker is installed.

2. Download the source code and run ```./install.sh```. Then run ```python gentle.py``` to start the server. This works on Mac and Linux.
